### A small app for demostrating Linear Algrebra's Affine Transformations
![Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation) is a good place to read about Affine Transformations.</br>
The math there has been tranplated into MatrixMath,py and is also availiable in this ![Repository](https://github.com/TeMyls/Miscellaneous-/tree/main/Matrix%20Math)</br>
Another demostration can be found using the game Engine/Framework Love2D ![here](https://github.com/TeMyls/Love2d-Projects/tree/main/Relative%20Rotation)

The math in question deals with the transformatuon matrices below.</br>
