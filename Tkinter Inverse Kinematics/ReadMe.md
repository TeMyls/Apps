#  Demostration of the Forward and Backwards Reaching Inverse Kinematics(FABRIK) algorithm

The difference between InverseKinematics 0 and 3 is that 0 is a more primitive version that uses  the same vertex navigation bar found in TP3D.py in my [Affine Transformation App](https://github.com/TeMyls/Apps/tree/main/Tkinter%20Inverse%20Kinematics)</br>
Thanks to Chris Tralie's [video](https://youtu.be/DOR0kO-UXsI?si=lHh8sDMlxBt9JKA2) that helped me gain the best conceptual understanding of the algorithm.</br>
