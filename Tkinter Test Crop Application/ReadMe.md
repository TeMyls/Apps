# Test Crop Application
This code served as the precusor to a major part of Program for Image and Video Editing in Tkinter or [PIVET](https://github.com/TeMyls/PIVET/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).</br>
The purpose was to see if the zooming, cropping, and frame navigation of various file types was possible, before implementing it in PIVET.</br>
Should work with mp4, mov, mkv, webm, and gif files, probably image files such as jpg and png as well.
