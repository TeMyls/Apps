### Scripts that I commonly use when making Tkinter Apps</br>
Vertex2D.py and Vertex 3D.py: Used to create 2D or 3D points in space and preform affine transformations to them</br>
collisions.py: general 2D collisions, points, circles, rectangles, and polygons made using [Jeffery Thompson's site](https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/)</br>
Tool_tip.py: Used to add tool tips windows to buttons and other widgets when the mouse is hovered over them.</br>
Matrix_Math.py and MatrixMath.py: Used for affine transformations either natively or using the NumPy library</br>
WidgetUtils.py: Used to control widget behavior from the layout, hiding or showing widgets that used the .pack() or .grid() methods, destroying them, or arranging them when placed in a two dimensional array, or altering their state.</br>
ScrollableFrame.py: An extension of the Scrollable frame code found on [Jose Salvatierra's Blog](https://blog.teclado.com/tkinter-scrollable-frames/) for directionality and ease of use.</br>
